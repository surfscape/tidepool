<Aside>Tidepool is a new project meaning that it's still incomplete and may contain mistakes or missing information.</Aside>

**Welcome to the SurfScape Tidepool**, the official wiki of the project.

Here you'll find extensive information about what we are, what we do, and how you can get involved in our community.

We've created Tidepool as a central, accessible space where anyone can explore our projects, principles, community, and other information.

If you're new to SurfScape, you might want to check out our [official website](https://surfscape.neocities.org) or reading the [About the project](/surfscape/about) page here in Tidepool.

Happy reading!
